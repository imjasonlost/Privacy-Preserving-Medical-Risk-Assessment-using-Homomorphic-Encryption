# Privacy-Preserving-Medical-Risk-Assessment-using-Homomorphic-Encryption
This repository contains preliminary codes to calculate Risk Score of Khorana Test and Diabetes Test (based on HbA1c values) using Homomorphic encryption. 
Paper based on this code is accepted at IEEE Secure Development Conference-2025, @Purdue University in Indianapolis. 
Polynomial approximation is done in order to compare real values in homomorphic encryption using Chebyshev polynomials. 
1) Data directory contains Originaaldata link and synthetic diabetes dataset
2) doc_FHE_setup directory contains pdf file which explains how to install OpenFHE library in PC
3) src directory contains all the necessary codes 
4) results directory contains some of the plots as result.
